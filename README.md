This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

# Digitize-Eth
This platform provides a dynamic marketplace for physical assets that are represented by NFTs. Whether you're interested in art, collectibles, you'll find a treasure trove of unique items to explore and acquire here.

## Tech Stack 
- Frontend & Backend: [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
- Web3 Framework: [ThirdWeb](https://thirdweb.com/)
  - Walletconnect feature
- Ethereum Attestation Serivce: [ESA](https://attest.sh/) 
  - This is used to KYC new users and verify the authenticity of the physical asset.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
